Advent of Code 2021

I am using [Julia](https://julialang.org/) for this year's Advent of Code.

*** Well, after getting tired of poor library support, and knowing that I wanted to practice algorithms, I decided to switch to python after all.

Usage:
(days 1 - 10)

    cd day1
    julia main.jl

(days 11 - 25)

    cd day11
    python main.py
